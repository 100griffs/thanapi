Unfortunately, they are currently facing a significant threat of extinction due to a contagious cancer known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD). This is a fatal and highly contagious disease that affects the facial tissue of Tasmanian devils, leading to severe disfigurement and eventually death`,
      about3: `Since the discovery of Devil Facial Tumour Disease in 1996, the population of Tasmanian devils has declined rapidly due to the disease's high mortality rate. It is estimated that the population has declined by up to 90%, leaving only 10,000 left in the wild. This is of grave concern for wildlife conservation efforts as the Tasmanian devil is an essential part of the ecosystem in Australia`,
      about4: `In order to protect the species, conservation efforts must be taken to reduce the spread of the disease and protect remaining Tasmanian devils. One proposed measure is to create “insurance populations” of Tasmanian devils in captivity in order to ensure the survival of the species. These captive populations would be kept in pest-free areas and monitored closely to make sure they remain healthy and disease-free.`

      About2: `Rhinos are among the most iconic and beloved mammals in the world, and yet they are facing a very real threat of extinction. Poaching and habitat loss have driven populations of rhinos to near extinction levels, with only around 30,000 rhinos left in the wild. At this rate, rhinos are on track to become extinct within the next decade, making it more important than ever to take action to help protect them.`,
      about3: `The most critically endangered species is the Javan rhino, with only an estimated 67-71 individuals remaining in the wild. The Sumatran rhino is also critically endangered, with an estimated population of just 80 individuals. Both of these species are under increasing threat from poaching and habitat destruction, and their numbers could be further reduced if conservation efforts are not increased. To help protect rhinos, conservation organizations have been working to protect their habitats and reduce poaching. Anti-poaching patrols have been set up in rhino habitats, and laws and regulations have been put in place to prevent poaching. Additionally, organizations such as the International Rhino Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund have been working to increase public awareness about rhinos and the threats they face.By supporting rhino conservation organizations, we can help ensure that future generations of rhinos are able to live in the wild. We can also help by reducing our impact on the environment and advocating for stricter regulations to protect rhino habitats. With our help, we can help ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures for years to come.`

      about2: `The black-footed ferret is a small, endangered mammal native to the United States. It is the only ferret species native to North America, and is the most endangered mammal in the United States. The black-footed ferret is a nocturnal predator, living in prairie dog colonies and preying on small mammals such as mice and voles. Due to its dependence on prairie dog colonies for food and shelter, the black-footed ferret is critically endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation.`,
      about3: `The black-footed ferret is listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and is protected by the federal government. Conservation efforts include reintroduction and habitat protection and restoration. The reintroduction of the black-footed ferret has been successful in some areas, but reintroduction efforts have not been able to keep up with the rate of habitat loss and fragmentation. To help protect the black-footed ferret, we can advocate for habitat protection and restoration, and support organizations that are working to recover the species. We can also reduce our own impact on the environment by reducing our use of pesticides and other chemicals, and by limiting our use of land in areas inhabited by the black-footed ferret. By supporting conservation efforts, we can help ensure that the black-footed ferret remains a part of the American landscape for generations to come.`

Once roaming the mainland of Australia as well as the island state of Tasmania, the species is believed to have been wiped out due to a combination of hunting, diseases, and habitat destruction.`,
        about3:`European settlers began to hunt the Tasmanian Tiger soon after they arrived in Australia. The species was seen as a pest and a threat to livestock, and so it was heavily poached. In addition, changes in the land due to farming and deforestation took away the Tiger’s habitat and food sources. Diseases, such as distemper, passed on to the Tiger by domestic animals, also had a devastating effect.`,
        about4:`By the 1930s, the Tasmanian Tiger had been pushed to the brink of extinction, and in 1936 it was declared extinct. Despite passionate efforts to save the species, and numerous reported sightings, the Tasmanian Tiger has not been seen in the wild since. The extinction of the Tasmanian Tiger is a tragedy for Australia and for the natural world. The loss of this species should be a reminder of the importance of conservation, and the need to protect vulnerable species from human activities.`,
